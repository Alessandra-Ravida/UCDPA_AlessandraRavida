Final assessment project for the UCDPA's 'Introduction to Data Analysis' course.  

This is the project I am submitting to the UCD Professional Academy for final assessment on the 'Introduction to Data Analysis' Certificate course. This is a 10 weeks part-time course.

In my project I am analysing Covid-19 datasets in Ireland. Firstly I explore the datasets per se and then I'll try to contextualise patterns and explore correlations with other data (such as infection trends in other countries, temperature and weather conditions, and the impact of some govenrnment restrictions on some specific cohorts).
